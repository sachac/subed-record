=subed-record= makes it easier to prepare text for subtitles, record a
voiceover, and then compile a video that includes the visuals, audio,
and subtitles specified by the text file.

I'm not sure it works for anyone but me at the moment, so if you run
into a problem, it's probably not you, it's me. Let me know and/or
help me figure it out! =)

* Prerequisites

You will need:

- [[https://github.com/rndusr/subed][subed]] is a mode for editing subtitles. It is not yet available as a
  package, but can get it from https://github.com/rndusr/subed .

- [[https://github.com/kljohann/mpv.el][mpv.el]] plays media files from within Emacs using the MPV
  command-line tool. mpv.el is available from MELPA, and MPV is
  available via either your operating system's package manager or from
  https://mpv.io/ .

- [[https://github.com/sachac/subed-waveform][subed-waveform]] is optional. You can use it to display the waveform
  for the current subtitle to help you fine-tune timestamps.
  
* Process

** Set things up

Take a look at the variables in =M-x customize-group subed-record=.

** Draft the text and collect the visuals

You can draft your text in an Org Mode file, using =file:= links to
include images or videos and =#+CAPTION:= to include captions. You may
want to wrap your lines to be as short as they will be in captions.

Image and video information should be one per line. Here's an example:

#+begin_src org

#+end_src

** Create the subtitle file.

Create a subtitle file (ex: recording.vtt) with the
segments you would like to record in one go.

#+begin_example
WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000

#+end_example

If you're starting with an Org Mode file, you can use
=subed-record-org-to-vtt= to extract the text from the current Org
subtree. It will keep captions and file links, and it will turn HTTP
links into regular text. It creates a file based on the current
filename, but with a =.vtt= extension.
** Record the voiceover
*** Option A: Record the voiceover using Emacs

Pick an appropriate =subed-record-backend=, such ='sox= if you have
the command-line =sox= and =rec= tools.

Use =subed-record= to start the recording. It will save the recording
into a file based on the name of the current subtitle file, but ending
with =subed-record-extension=.

Default keybindings:

| right    | accept current segment and continue |
| left     | retry current segment               |
| up       | go back one segment                 |
| down     | go forward one segment              |
| RET or q | stop recording                      |

=subed-record= overwrites the recording file each time it is called.
If you want to re-record a different segment and splice it into the
rest of your presentation, you can create a new =.vtt= file and use
=subed-record= to record into a different audio file. Then you can
include that segment in your original =.vtt= file with an =#+AUDIO:
...= specification, like this:

#+begin_example
00:00:45.864 --> 00:00:47.644

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.840
#+AUDIO: native.ogg

on native compilation too.
#+end_example

NOTE: subed.el automatically sorts subtitles by timestamp. If you move
subtitles around or use this technique to combine different audio files,
you may need to disable automatic subed sorting with something like the following code:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'subed
  (add-hook 'subed-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (remove-hook 'before-save-hook #'subed-sort t))))
#+end_src

*** Option B: Record the audio and edit it using your favourite tool, then create subtitles

Alternatively, you can start with an already-edited audio file and
then use =subed-mode='s commands to create, split, or adjust subtitles
so that they match your audio file.

** Split the subtitles into shorter captions

Load the recording with =C-c C-v= (=subed-mpv-find-video=). You may
want to turn off looping with =C-c C-l=
(=subed-toggle-loop-over-current-subtitle=).

You can then use the following keyboard shortcuts to divide the
subtitles into shorter captions if needed.

| =M-j=   | =subed-mpv-jump-to-current-subtitle= |
| =M-SPC= | =subed-mpv-toggle-pause=             |
| =M-.=   | =subed-split-subtitle=               |

** Fine-tune the starting and ending timestamps

You can adjust the timestamps by manually typing in new values or by
using the following keyboard shortcuts:

| =M-[= | =subed-decrease-start-time= |
| =M-]= | =subed-increase-start-time= |
| =M-{= | =subed-decrease-stop-time=  |
| =M-}= | subed-increase-stop-time=   |

It can be easier to determine the starting and stopping timestamps
from the waveform instead of trying to pause at the right
moment. [[https://github.com/sachac/subed-waveform][subed-waveform]] allows you to see the waveform for the current
subtitle, play samples at different positions, and set the start or
stop times.

** Test the flow of different segments

To test whether the audio flows together, mark a region and use
=M-x subed-record-compile-try-flow=. You may want to bind this to a
convenient shortcut with something like the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'subed-record
  (define-key subed-mode-map
    (kbd "C-c C-c") 
    #'subed-record-compile-try-flow))
#+end_src

This exports the audio segments in the region to a new file specified
by =subed-record-compile-output-filename= (default: =output.webm=),
overwriting existing files. After processing, it will play it in a
separate MPV process. You can stop playing with =M-x mpv-kill=.

** Test the visuals

You can test the visuals as well.  =M-x
subed-record-compile-test-visuals= compiles all the images, animated
GIFs, and videos from the subtitle file into the output file specified
by =subed-record-compile-output-filename= (default: =output.webm=)
with a duration of 1 second per visual.

To tweak the display, consider customizing the following variables:

- =subed-record-compile-description-height=
- =subed-record-compile-caption-height=
- =subed-record-compile-output-video-width=
- =subed-record-compile-output-video-height=
- =subed-record-compile-description-drawtext-filter-params=
  
** Compile the video

Clear the region or select the whole buffer, then run =M-x
subed-record-compile-video=.  This will compile the video, audio, and
subtitles into the output file specified by
=subed-record-compile-output-filename= (default: =output.webm=).

Audio segments will be concatenated, one after the other. Visuals
(specified by file: links) will be stretched or squeezed to fit the
time until the next visual is specified. Visual information will be
removed from the subtitles, and the resulting subtitles will accompany
the audio segments.
